MAYSOON AHMAD, M.A.Sc.

Attn: Human Resources Department

Dear Hiring Manager:

Please accept my resume in consideration for the position with your company. I’m a University of Waterloo alumni with a Master of Applied Sciences degree in Chemical Engineering.

I have a passion to do programming since I was doing my master, so I started working hard to learn more in python. I am planning to be certified in CS.

I got an opportunity to work on a project which integrates my chemical engineering background and enhances my software skills. The project target was to help human to predict the air pollution sources. I am looking for an opportunity to enhance the idea by leveraging software module to analyze the data and predict a strategy to help environmental engineers to make the right decision about how to control the hazard resourcing.

I am looking forward to using my technical engineering skills, root-cause-analysis, strong analytical, statistical data analysis, and strong problem-solving skills. Within me, you will discover a reliable, detail-oriented and extremely hard worker. I am a team worker with an open mindset.

It would be a great pleasure to listen and speak with you.

Kind regards,

Maysoon Ahmad

My background is in Chemical engineering with a wide range of experiences . I always had an interest in coding and was curious about technology which led me to change careers. I love coding and creating new things from scratch. It’s so fascinating to know that every piece of code I’m writing has a potential to solve a problem. I completed a Software development bootcamp where I learned C# and how to create a web app using ASP.NET Core MVC and I improved my coding skills.

Experience
Software Development Student (Deep stack) Kal Academy Feb2020-current

Project: Music Library App 
-----------------------------------
▪ Developed a music application on UWP platform where users can build their music collection, create play lists, search and  
   play music.
▪ Implemented Add Music feature in the app where user can add music from local files to the application. 

Tools and Technologies Used: C#, Asp.net framework, XAML Designer, Visual Studio, VSTS and Git.
Design Patterns: MVVM

Project: Eventbrite
-----------------------
▪ Developed a web application that allows anyone to create, share, find and attend events across different places and streams. User can add events to their wish list and manage.
▪ The application is backed by 4 micro services - Orders, Event Catalog, Cart, and Identity Token services. Each service provides set of RESTful APIs to perform CRUD operations specific to the functionality.
▪ Developed a messaging channel using Rabbit MQ to update the user wish list status as already registered based on events from orders placed.
▪ Developed an in-memory data store using Redis to store and manage user wish list. Wish list Object will be serialized/DE-serialized to/from JSON before saving/retrieving data into/from Redis.
▪ All the five micro services, MS SQL server, Redis and Rabbit MQ services has been containerized using Docker to run on a single server.

Technologies used: C#, JSON, .Net Core Framework, Entity Framework, Rabbit MQ, Redis, SQL, Docker, Swagger, MVC Framework, Postman, JSON

2009 - 2014 
Responsibilities
•	Air quality forecasting project: an integrated Analysis of the air pollution forcing using Calpuff and python: The project target was to analysis a raw data for air pollutants (the mixture of gases) from different factories in Ontario area. We used python to parse and filter the requirement data in order to use it as an input for Calpuff(dispersion model). Calpuff support AI to predict air pollution. The module can be used as a future project to simulate environment hazard prediction. AI and ML (machine learning) can be used as tools to monitor and reserve air quality .AI and ML will help human to predict pollution and track pollution sources. 
•	Assessment of mathematical models for Ultrafiltration of multi-solute continuous cross-flow process using MATLAB.
•	Simulate the treatment of Industrial Phenolic Liquid Effluents using MATLAB.
•	Odour assessment project: Applying Calpuff(dispersion model)to quantify the odour potential impact in the environment of a proposed facility in the Carp, Ontario. Where CALPUFF used to simulate the dispersion and to get a predicted concentration.
•	Teaching assistants
